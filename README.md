Project Title: The Cubic Combatant

Project Vision: For gamers who are interested in Platformers that have a balanced difficulty curve, no in-game purchases and non-monotonous collectathons. The Cubic Combatant is a 3D Platformer game that aims to be easy to play, but hard to master, and Players need to use their skills and knowledge of the game mechanics they have learnt to figure out how to accomplish the level on their own.
